# A3G-SpectatorCam
A simple spectator cam script made for AGM users. Compatible with ACRE and TFAR.

## Usage
To activate the camera when the player gets killed just copy the Description.ext provided into your missions folder (usually found under `...\My Documents\Arma 3 - Other Profiles\Profilename\missions\Missioname.Mapname`). If you already have a Description.ext, copy the contents of the one provided into yours.
